hey laetitia,

hope this email finds you well. I appreciate you trying to find me a space in the office
but i dont think its necessary for me to go at this point of the cycle. It will be more useful for me to develop in location
when the design is being wrapped up or when we have to resolve responsive problems. For now and
our Weds deadline, you gave me enough direction to continue development
on the pages and subpages templates for browser. if there is any updates that have been made since our friday meeting
please send those my way asap :)

Lets schedule a skype meeting, where you can share your screen and show me the
additional references or aspects of the work i need to be looped in on.

 
talk to you soon.
Delia
